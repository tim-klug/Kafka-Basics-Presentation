## What is Apache Kafka?

> Apache Kafka is an open-source __stream-processing__ software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java. The project aims to provide a unified, high-throughput, low-latency platform for handling __real-time__ data feeds. Its storage layer is essentially a "massively scalable pub/sub message queue designed as a distributed transaction log," making it highly valuable for enterprise infrastructures to process streaming data.
